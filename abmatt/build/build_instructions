IMPORTANT: update config.txt before building!
Building the distribution is done through build.py.
It uses the 'pyinstaller' package to build the binaries. It creates a single file/folder in the 'dist' folder.
The installer for distributions is also created, but may require additional dependencies:

For Windows you need the following on your system path:
1. makensis (windows installer)
    a. Additionally the EnVar plug-in is required.
2. 7z (zipping installer)
